Open Source Chess Game for Windows developed in C#

The Quick Chess application can be used by two users to play the Chess game on the computer, plus you can also play with Computer, or just be a spectator, and let the Computer play the game (in Computer vs Computer mode).

The main idea and inspiration behind this game was not to develop another competitive world class Chess Game, but I just wanted to learn and program the Chess game. So if you want to learn about the board programming in general, and Chess programming in the particular, this open source application may be handy.

<b>Note:</b> Please note that even though Artificial Intelligence used in the Chess application follows all the normal Chess rules, and tries to do play a fair game, it's not very powerful. Thus any good chess player can easily beat the computer player. If you are really looking for a good Chess Application to play game with computer, there are plenty of free available chess games on internet (hint, just try searching for phrase like "Chess Master" on Google).

<b>Acknowledgement:</b> I must thank the Peter Hughes of the http://www.sharpchess.com site, from whose application source code I have learned a lot about Chess programming. I should also thanks Bruce Moreland, and his excellent guide on Chess programming at http://www.brucemo.com/compchess/programming/index.htm
